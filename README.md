# About Me
Ever since I began to take my first steps into the world of full-stack development, Iâ€™ve had deep appreciations and a strong will to develop innovative technology, whether it be simple website applications or breathtaking UI experiences, I long to leave a mark in the world of technology. I am a freshly budding engineer that is eager to be a sponge and soak up all the knowledge I can and continue to grow with any company that gives me the chance.
